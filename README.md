# HW-Script
Creates boilerplate homework tex file

## How it Works

The script only needs one argument, which defines the homework number. The script then takes in your name, class name, and professor name, and store it all in a text file. Using this info it will automatically generate a tex file so you can go straight to writing your HW assignment without having to set it up.

## How to Use:
Copy `create.sh` into whatever folder you want to store your homework files

Type `chmod u+x create.sh`

Run the script with your homework number. Example: `./create.sh 1`
